# QnA_Backend

## Project Description
I was tasked with revamping the backend questions and answers service of an e-commerce product details page that contained an existing legacy API on a monolithic architecture. This project uses a Nodejs Express server for routing and accesses a Postgreql database. Optimization was done connecting multiple AWS EC2 instances with an Nginx load balancer. Testing was done with K6 for local benchmarks and loader.io for cloud testing, with all tests being automatically uploaded to NewRelic.
