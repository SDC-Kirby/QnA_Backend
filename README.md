# QnA_Backend

## Project Description
I was tasked with revamping the backend questions and answers service of an e-commerce product details page that contained an existing legacy API on a monolithic architecture. This project uses a Nodejs Express server for routing and accesses a Postgreql database. Testing was done with K6 for local benchmarks and loader.io for cloud testing, with all tests being automatically uploaded to NewRelic.
